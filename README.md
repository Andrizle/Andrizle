<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew</h1>

<h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
<div>
I'm a software engineer coming from the a stem background in the medical field. I have a knack for problem solving, and I love that the tech field is ever evolving. These two factors are what really drew me into software engineering, and I'm more than ready to get my journey underway.

My background two most recent jobs have solidified my skills in communication and leadership, as well as working diligently under pressure while self supervised. These are all values that I've carried with me my whole life, but they've only gotten sharper with time. These are the traits I bring with me into the software engineering realm that will allow me to go far. Regardless of what task is put in front of me, I always approach it with the same level of care. I'm always pushing myself to my limits to provide the best work I have to offer, and I love feedback and learning from others to help me better myself and my work.

All of this is not to say I don't know how to relax. In my free time, you get one of two sides. Either I'm going outdoors hiking, camping, off-roading and enjoying nature, or I'm staying in relaxing with friends on discord, gaming on my pc or watching anime. I'm always down for anything, so while I'm mostly cozied up at home, if a friend reaches out to me with plans, you can count on me being there.
